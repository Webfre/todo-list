- [Reset CSS] - A reset style sheet (or CSS reset) is a set of CSS rules used to clean up the formatting of HTML browser elements by default, eliminating potential inconsistencies between different browsers.
- [ESlint] - ESLint is a tool that helps you analyze JavaScript code, find syntax errors and automatically correct them, write neat code in a uniform style according to certain rules.
